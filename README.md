# GeometricArtGenerator

This JavaScript code creates a web application and allows users to create patterns by playing with colors and shapes.

How does it work?

1. Shape and Color Selection: Users randomly select shapes and colors defined in the "shapes" and "colors" arrays.

2. Pattern Generation: When the user clicks on the "Generate Pattern" button or the page loads, a random shape and color is assigned for each box.

3. Pattern View: Boxes are filled with selected random shapes and colors so users can see the pattern created.

##

Features:

- Random Patterns: With each "Generate Pattern" click or page load, the boxes are filled with random shapes and colors, creating different patterns each time.

- User Interaction: Users can click a button to recreate the pattern, which updates the contents of the boxes with random shapes and colors.

This code allows users to create fun and dynamic patterns and can help them visually enrich their web pages or applications.
